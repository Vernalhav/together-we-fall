  story: "...My God, I can\u2019t believe it!\r\nChief! The bunker has been invaded!
    Svorovian soldiers have found this hideout, taken most of the supplies and equipment...
    Our colleagues have been murdered, Chief! Their bodies are inside... It seems
    like the Svorovians left the bunker a few days ago.\r"
