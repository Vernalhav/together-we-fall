  story: "Chief! I have some information! We\u2019re 40 kilometers away from Bunker
    51. It was built by our government to protect and give shelter to soldiers in
    war.\r\nWe might be able to find supplies and maybe even find some soldiers that
    are sheltering from Svorov\u2019s invasion.\r"
