  story: "I didn\u2019t imagine that I\u2019d ever be so happy to see my home country
    again. These lands are so familiar to me that I might be getting a little emotional.\r\nI
    couldn\u2019t stop remembering the time that everything was ok... I was in my
    kitchen, having dinner with my husband. The time that I was in front of my canvas
    almost every day, looking at beautiful nature... The trees, birds, blue skies...
    Now everything is looking grim, destroyed and dead.\r"
