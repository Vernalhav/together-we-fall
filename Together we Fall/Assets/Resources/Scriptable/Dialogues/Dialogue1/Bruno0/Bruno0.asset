  story: "Chief, I\u2019m sorry to trouble you at this late hour, but I must speak
    of a matter most urgent. While the soldiers were settling down to sleep, some
    of the men noticed strange behaviour coming from Carlos.\nHis mates reported
    seeing him with bloodshot eyes, screaming for apparently no reason and saying
    completely nonsensical things to himself.\r\nYour thoughts are the same as mine,
    Chief... the boy is with PS\u201120. There is no way to keep him with us any
    longer, otherwise we\u2019ll risk our whole platoon falling victim to this plague.\nI
    do not come to this conclusion lightly: my crew and I went through all possibilities
    to try to recover the boy and came up empty.\r"
  opt1: 'Goddamnit! Better to lose one than lose all: Get rid of the boy.'
  opt2: "I can\u2019t believe it... what should we do?"
