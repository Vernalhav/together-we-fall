  story: "Good job, everyone! I told you these Svorovian bastards had no chance against
    us! They have numbers, weapons, discipline and every luxury their little country
    can give them. But do you know what they don\u2019t have?! They don\u2019t have
    a family like us!! That\u2019s what makes us better and that\u2019s what will
    lead us to victory! Hahahahaha!!\r\nSee that, Chief? Our boys are brimming! I
    haven\u2019t seen them excited like this in a long time. We won a great victory
    today.\r"
