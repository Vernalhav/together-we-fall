  story: "If you want my opinion, I also believe our only option is to fight them.
    Samantha and I made some calculations and if we wanted to avoid this confrontation
    we would have to extend our journey at least 5 more days and have almost twice
    as many provisions as we currently have.\r\nHowever, I do think that since the
    battle is unavoidable, we might as well get whatever edge we can on them. While
    Samantha and her speeches might lead you to think that we should go in recklessly,
    we must approach this situation tactically.\r"
  opt1: "Absolutely. Let\u2019s march in after causing a distraction."
  opt2: "Of course! Let\u2019s attack while they are changing their watch."
