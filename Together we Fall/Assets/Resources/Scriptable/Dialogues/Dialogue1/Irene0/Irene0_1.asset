  story: "I\u2019m glad you asked! I\u2019ve been helping out Samantha by talking
    to the soldiers and keeping track of their morale; she\u2019s even asked for
    my advice a few times. You wouldn\u2019t believe the amount of stories that the
    boys tell! They really see all of you as family.\r\nI\u2019ve also spent some
    time with Bruno and helped him by getting the things he needs when he has people
    to treat. My mom used to tell me I would become a doctor because I never found
    it gross to look at the inside of animals. Well, I didn\u2019t turn out to be
    a doctor but I have certainly seen some gross things with Bruno!\r\nI don\u2019t
    see Dante as much because ever since he got back to walking properly, all he
    wants is to go scouting. From what we\u2019ve talked, I think he really likes
    to be away and have some time to himself.\nHave you ever talked to him when he
    gets philosophical? I have a feeling that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg
    of his inner thoughts.\r\nOh, and little Gabriel is the cutest thing, isn\u2019t
    he? Whenever I try to talk to him, he gets red as an apple! Hahahaha!\r"
