  story: "Apart from this damned cold, everything is fine by me! Have you talked
    to the other soldiers lately, Chief? I\u2019ve been getting to know them and
    their stories.\r\nIt\u2019s  truly beautiful to see so many people from completely
    different backgrounds coming together to fight for a common cause. Did you know
    that they call our platoon \u201Clittle family\u201D?\r\nAll of this anthropological
    richness has inspired me to write and paint about what I\u2019ve heard from them.
    You wouldn\u2019t happen to have a canvas lying around, would you? Hahahahaha!\r"
