  story: "Chief! I have important news, sir. We\u2019ve just found a message from
    the Head of Pazzio\u2019s Military Department that was sent two weeks ago and
    got intercepted by the Svorovians.\r\nIt says that Svorov has retaliated and
    they\u2019re dominating our borders. Pazzio had to recall all of its platoons
    urgently to the Capital to keep Svorov from overthrowing our government!\r"
  opt1: Damn it! This message would have been useful a few hours ago!
  opt2: "Recalled all of the platoons?! That\u2019s madness!"
