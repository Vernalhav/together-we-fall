  story: "...Chief... we were scouting ahead... we were looking for any traps, as
    usual... but our Border Control Zone was... taken *cough*.\r\nWe thought it was
    too easy... no signs of any Svorovians... we could see the Border Control Zone
    and thought... we thought we were done, mission complete... that we just needed
    to... to cross it with all of you and we would be home again... home with the
    cure. I was wrong. Svorov killed all of our men at the Zone.\r\nRemember, Chief?
    We talked to them when we passed by the Border Control at the start of our mission...
    Christian, Jhon, Marcelo, Julia... they are all dead. And Svorov holds the Zone
    now...\r"
