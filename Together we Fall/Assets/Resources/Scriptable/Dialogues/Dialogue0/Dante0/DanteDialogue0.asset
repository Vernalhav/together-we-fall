  story: "Fall is beautiful, isn't it? All these dead leaves, the trees naked; oblivious
    to the cold that is coming, oblivious to the struggle of the animals all around
    them. I just find it fascinating for whatever reason...\nAah, but I know you
    didn\u2019t come looking for me just to hear a homesick scout\u2019s ramblings.
    Is there anything I can do to help?\r\nOh, yes! Samantha and I were the first
    ones to help her out of her confinement cell. Lovely girl, isn\u2019t she? We
    talked a little bit and we told her how our little family is structured and who
    does what. Has she already talked to you?\r \nI see. So, are we ready to make
    our way back home?\r"
  opt1: "Yes.\r"
  opt2: I want to know your opinion first.
