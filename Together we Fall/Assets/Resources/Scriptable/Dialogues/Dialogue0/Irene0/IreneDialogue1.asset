  story: "I know that if I were anyone else, Pazzio would not have commanded you
    to come rescue me. Just know that I\u2019ll try to pull my own weight and be
    useful around here. I know how to paint, sing, I\u2019m really good with numbers
    and I\u2019m good at talking to people, too.\nIf you see any way I could lend
    a helping hand in the platoon, just say the word and I\u2019ll get to work. I\u2019ll
    see you around, Chief.\r"
